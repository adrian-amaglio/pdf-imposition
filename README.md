The original repository can be found [here](https://framagit.org/niilos/pdf_imposition "framagit repo")

This bash scrip is able to impose a pdf file from A5 pages to A4 paper sheets.

### Roadmap (todos)
* Keep the quality of pages (it is currently smashed)
* Generalize the imposition to any AN sizes
* Add a webserver that upload a pdf and impose it
* Wrap it all in a docker container
